Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – Individual Project
Data Analytics – Phase 4 (UNAD 2025)
Author: Wilmar Alfredo Triana
📌 Overview

This repository contains my individual implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed for Phase 4 of the UNAD Data Analytics course.

The core objective is to classify IoT network traffic as either Benign or Malicious, using machine learning techniques applied to the dataset iotsim-combined-cycle-10.csv.

The project implements a complete ML pipeline:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection

Handling missing values

Class balancing with SMOTE

Training a Random Forest classifier

Performance evaluation

Saving the trained model and scaler

This repository represents my personal contribution (individual work) for Phase 4.

🎯 Objectives
General Objective

Develop a binary Intrusion Detection System capable of detecting malicious IoT traffic using supervised machine learning techniques.

Specific Objectives

Load and prepare the selected dataset.

Conduct exploratory analysis to understand traffic patterns.

Apply SMOTE to fix dataset imbalance.

Train a Random Forest classifier.

Evaluate performance with standard metrics.

Save the model and scaler for deployment.
